## Get started

Download the GUI from the [latest release](https://github.com/jinghaihan/feth-save-editor/releases/latest), open a `slotXX` or `auto` save, make your edits, then save a copy to another folder. Keep your original save until you have checked the edited copy in-game. The editor targets Fire Emblem: Three Houses v1.2.0.

To run from source with the .NET 10 SDK:

```sh
dotnet run --project Gui/FethEditor.Gui.csproj -c Release
```

For scripted edits, see the [CLI guide](CLI.md).
